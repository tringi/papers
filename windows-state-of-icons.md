## Prologue

I was raised on classic Mac OS 7. My friends, as a kid, were Linux nerds. Despite that I eventually chose Windows all those years back.
One reason was its powerful API, to write my apps in. But the main reason was its emphasis on consistency and pixel-perfect graphics.
If I'm supposed to be starring at something 12 hours a day, it better be intuitive, look crisp and not strain my eyesight.

Those things were achieved through heavily hinted [ClearType](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/cleartype/) text rendering,
GUI with customizable colors and proper contrast,
and small icons being hand-crafted simplified variantions of the regular ones. Not just naively resized down to ugly blurry blobs of colors.

This rant is about the icons.

TBD
